# My first Erlang program
Now check that you understand the basics of writing a complete Erlang program - by writing one for yourself!

The aim of this exercise is to familiarise you with using Erlang, and with writing, modifying and running simple Erlang programs. You are asked to modify the file first.erl (available under ‘Downloads’ below) to include a definition of a new function. You’ll then define a module second.erl, and use functions from first.erl in second.erl.

A further document is provided below (under ‘Downloads’), giving some hints about common mistakes made when writing and running Erlang programs.

## Modifying first.erl
The module first.erl is available below.

In a text editor of your choice modify first.erl to include functions to square and to treble a value, and test these functions out by calling them from the Erlang shell.

## Defining second.erl
Using your text editor of choice, define a new module second.erl to include the following functions:

- Using the function square from first.erl, define a function that gives the size of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle given the lengths of the two other sides.

- Define functions that give the perimeter and area of a right-angled triangle, given the lengths of the two short sides.

Which functions can you re-use in making these definitions? Which existing definitions can you modify to give you the answers? You might want to discuss the approach you have taken in the comments for this step.

You should test your functions by trying them out in the Erlang shell.
